## My blog!
I don't think it really requires a README. No special instructions here. Just keep in mind that this is geared towards beginning developers who get confused along the way - as it's absolutely bound to happen. 

If you are a developer who knows exactly what he or she is doing, feel free to leave comments if you have any suggestions of what to add. Always appreciated!
