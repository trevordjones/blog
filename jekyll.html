<h2>Getting started with your Jekyll blog</h2>

<p>So Jekyll is interesting. Parts of it are well documented on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll's website</a> . . . other parts are hard to follow and can easily trip you up if you are new to Git, Github, Markdown, Liquid Syntax . . . everything Jekyll uses. This a tutorial for those unfamiliar with everything Jekyll. Below are posts (in the order you should follow them) that will hopefully get you started with it. I can't promise it'll be done in minutes like Jekyll promises, but it shouldn't be too painful for you and you will come out with a better understanding of what is going on. After all, Jekyll shouldn't only be for those who already know what they're doing.</p>

<p>With these posts, I will often be referring you to Jekyll's documentation - like I said, many times it is pretty straightforward and there is no use in repeating what is already well put. But using their documentation at other times - someone new to it all will take hours, maybe even weeks (depending on their time) to learn and understand. The goal of these posts are to be quick wins to point you in the right direction so you can get up and going in far less time. Here we go!</p>
