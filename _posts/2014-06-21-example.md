## Using the terminal and figuring out Git

Brand new to Git and Github? Not much experience with programming languages in general? Perfect! You're in the right place. If you did lots of googling like I did to try and figure out Github and repositories, you probably found there weren't many (if any) well documented tutorials to teach you the basics. If you don't have a technical background it's just hard to get started because everyone writes for a technical audience.

As mentioned in my about page, I'm learning to program/develop websites this summer in a coding bootcamp. We recently learned about Git, so I'd like to explain what I learned and hopefully help to translate it to those who don't have a technical background, like myself. I tried to learn a lot of it on my own before my courses started and it was so confusing - hopefully my non-technical background will give me an advantage when trying to explain it. Lastly, this will be thorough, but if you really want to understand what's going on, you need thorough. It's broken up into parts, so take it step by step.


Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use `figure` with the appropriate `class`. Each instance of `figure` is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.

## Figures (for images or video)

### One Up

<figure>

</figure>

### Two Up

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="half">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg" alt="">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg" alt="">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt="">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt="">
	<figcaption>Two images.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Three Up

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="third">
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="third">
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg" alt=""></a>
